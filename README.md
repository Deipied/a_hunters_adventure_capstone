# A Hunter's Adventure

Welcome to Team 3 PRG text-based adventure game! This project is still in progress but please feel free to run the program and try it out! You can even bring additional features to make this game better!


As a player, you can execute the following commands:

go [direction] - move in the specified direction
look - Read the description of the current room, and the items available and player's status. Displays any NPCs in the area to speak to.
get [item] - pick up the specified item
talk [NPC name] - Attempt to talk to the specified NPC. Viable NPC names are fully capitalized in location descriptions.
help - display commands available
quit - exit the game and return to menu


You would encounter a couple of checkpoints where you are required to have certain item(s) to gain access to the next area, so you need pay attention to the description of each location / item to look for hints! If you are lost in the game, you can obtain the map somewhere in the game and view all locations available in the game.
